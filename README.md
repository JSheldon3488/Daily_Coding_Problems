# Daily_Coding_Problems
My work on coding problems from the book "Daily Coding Problem".

This is the repository where I will keep all my code as I work threw the book "Daily Coding Problem" by Alex Miller and Lawrence Wu. 

The general format will be:

1. Chapter.Section: Name of problem
2. Problem Statement
3. My solutions along with some general notes about my solutions and/or the problem.

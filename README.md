# Daily_Coding_Problems
My work on coding problems from the book "Daily Coding Problem".

This is the repository where I will keep all my code as I work threw the book "Daily Coding Problem" by Alex Miller and Lawrence Wu. 

The general format will be:

1. Chapter.Section: Name of problem
2. Problem Statement
3. My solutions along with some general notes about my solutions and/or the problem.
4. The Books solution along with some notes about my mistakes and lessons learned from the books solutions.
5. Simple Test cases to make sure my solutions work.
6. A Short Lesson's Learned section to highlight the big takeaways from the problem.

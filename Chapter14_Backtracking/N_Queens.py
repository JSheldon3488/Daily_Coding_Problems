N Queens Problem
"""

'''
Problem Statement: This problem is introduced at the beginning of the chapter to introduce backtracking. I want to see 
a solution and explanation for this problem but I think that the books solution and explanation is terrible. So I am going
to look around on the internet and post the solution and lessons learned here.

The N Queen is the problem of placing N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens attack each other.
Example: 
    n = 4
    :returns  { 0,  1,  0,  0}
              { 0,  0,  0,  1}
              { 1,  0,  0,  0}
              { 0,  0,  1,  0}

Notice here that no two queens (represented as 1's) could attack each other in chess.

Base case is that all queens are replaced and we can return true (check a valid solution)
For all rows in the current column try to place a queen in this row,column, if it is valid then recursively try to
solve the problem from here. if placing that queen lead to a solution base case will return true. If placing queen doesnt
lead to a solution then unmark this row,column (backtrack) and go to the next row. If all rows were tried return flase
to trigger backtracking to move on to the next column.

Lessons Learned:
    * Saw a trick bug here. If I create a row then put that row in with a list comprehension like so [row for i in range(N)] then
        all the rows in the board will point to the same thing! row here is a reference to the underlying List so I just pass
        in 4 references instead of 4 lists.
    * It seems like these back tracking recursive solutions hinge on you popping off the previous solution at the right time
        after that path did not lead to a solution.
